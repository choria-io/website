After a few months break on sabbatical and other changes we're back with some new releases.

The main focus here is Puppet 8 and Ruby 3.2 support and this has largely been a community effort which was very 
good to see.

While we're moving our Puppet support forward we are also working on a future independent of Puppet. You might 
be aware that we have a Provisioner that can guide unconfigured Choria instances to being fully managed instances. 
The Provisioner though is focussed on configuration only, not on deployment of agents and other plugins.

Over the last year or so we have started designing ways to deliver Autonomous Agents at runtime, we now also support
delivering External Agents in this manner. In this way by placing a manifest of agents in a Key-Value bucket Choria
Server can completely deploy itself and it's plugins. Next we'll either turn our Ruby agents into Extenral Agents or
add the same ability to Ruby agents.

This is a big milestone in being Puppet free as there are no single point that still requires Puppet to go from zero to
a full Choria environment. We have a bit to go here, but it's conceivable that we might switch our standard deploy 
to start using these mechanisms to deploy plugins and configure Choria. 

In the end we will still support a Puppet deployment method but it will become much simpler as we will only need to do
a small part of the overall heavy lifting using Puppet. We will also unlock full featured environments backed by 
Kubernetes and other hosting environments.

Thanks to Jeff McCune, Pieter Loubser, Trey Dockendorf, Ryan Dill, Mark Dechiaro and Romain Tarti√®re, Vincent Janelle for 
their support in making these releases possible.
