The Choria Server is a process and emendable library written in the Go programming language.  Choria Server as available on our package repositories is a typical build that supports the deployment model of the Puppet modules, however you can build your own binaries and packages. When building your own several extension points exist, this guide covers those points.

We'll first have to learn how to build a custom Choria Binary and Package and after that we'll explore individual plugin types.
