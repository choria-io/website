## Overview

Choria is an ongoing project to create a new Orchestration System with roots in The Marionette Collective (mcollective).  It's part trivially installable mcollective and part brand new development of turn key end user features, new content and modernization.

Using Choria an Open Source Puppet user can be up and running with a scalable, clustered, secure orchestration system within 30 minutes.  Out of the box it's known to support 50 000 nodes on a single compute node while being secure by default, easy to maintain and production ready.

As Puppet Inc is in the process of sunsetting The Marionette Collective the Choria Project safe guards the investment users have made through a compatibility framework capable of running mcollective agents.

Review the [Key Concepts](../concepts) section to discover what you can do with Choria, it's Architecture and detailed overview of the project.

## Status

This system is production ready but under active development.  At various fronts we are working to replace reliance on Puppet Agent and legacy MCollective, the project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/choria-io).

Extensive performance testing has been done that showed the system to be stable at over 100 000 nodes.  Getting to 50 000 nodes is easily achievable using a single middleware compute node.
